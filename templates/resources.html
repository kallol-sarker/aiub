<h3 class="text-center">Laboratory Facilities</h3>
<img class="pull-left" src="/Files/Uploads/archive/eng1.jpg" style="height:167px; width:227px" /><img lass="pull-right" src="/Files/Uploads/archive/eng2.jpg" style="height:167px; width:258px" />American International University-Bangladesh recognizes the fact that a quality engineering education requires quality laboratories. In that direction the Faculty of Engineering features as many as 16 state-of-the-art engineering laboratories for the Electrical and Electronic and the Computer Engineering students. The laboratories range from the basic fields of electrical circuits (2 labs), electrical machines (2 labs), electrical appliances, analog electronics (2 labs) and digital electronics and logic design (2 labs) to the more advanced and specialized areas of power and industrial electronics, control systems, microprocessor and i/o systems, computer networks and system architecture, telecommunications, microwave engineering and VLSI. <img lass="pull-left" src="/Files/Uploads/archive/eng3.jpg" style="height:167px; width:215px" /><img class="pull-right" src="/Files/Uploads/archive/eng4.jpg" style="height:168px; width:239px" />These high quality laboratories, each equipped with no less than 6 workbenches for a capacity of 24 students, not only provide the engineering students with the required support a rigorous engineering program demands but also exceed those requirements quite substantially. Because of the knowledge they will acquire in the laboratories, after successful completion of the undergraduate programs in Electrical and Electronic or Computer Engineering the students will learn to apply modern electrical or computer engineering techniques, tools, and practices to solve technological problems and challenges of the future to meet the needs of the society.<br />
<img src="/Files/Uploads/archive/eng5.jpg" style="float:left; height:172px; width:251px" /><img src="/Files/Uploads/archive/eng6.jpg" style="height:199px; width:239px" />The Department of Architecture at present has 7 full-fledged design studios. Students in the Bachelor of Architecture are benefited from these modern and spacious design studios as they realize their creative ideas uninhibited. The department is further expanding its studio facilities. The resources also include exhibition space, jury lounge, computer lab etc. <strong>Chemistry Laboratory</strong> <img src="/Files/Uploads/archive/eng7.gif" style="float:left; height:135px; width:180px" /><img src="/Files/Uploads/archive/eng8.gif" style="float:left; height:160px; width:120px" /> AIUB has two modern Chemistry Laboratories equipped with high quality analytical instruments involving the basics of physical and inorganic chemistry suitable for standard undergraduate level. The laboratory having the capacity of 40 students is ideal for practical exercises in 8 groups. As a core subject for B. Sc. Engineering degree in Computer and Electrical &amp; Electronics, students are presently being performed a good number of experiments based on the theory. The experiments are for example- acid-base titration, redox titration and estimation of Cu, Fe, Ca etc. and conductometric analyses. After successful completion of the course students will be able to understand and solve the basic chemistry related problems with special reference to the properties of elements, acid-base concepts, electrical &amp; thermal properties of the solutions etc. and will find them confident in their future academic and working positions. <strong>Physics Laboratory</strong> <img src="/Files/Uploads/archive/eng9.gif" style="float:left; height:135px; width:180px" /><img src="/Files/Uploads/archive/eng10.gif" style="float:left; height:135px; width:180px" /> In subjects like Physics, the laboratory work, popularly known as practical classes, is no less important than the theoretical lectures. In performing an experiment in the laboratory, students are required to revise thoroughly the ideas and the principles involved in the experiment which were explained by the teachers in the theoretical classes. Thus practical classes serve as a sort of revision exercises of the theoretical lectures and at the same time provide students a hands-on-experience about the underlying principles of the theoretical knowledge gained in the theory classes. Moreover, laboratory work provides students a training to present scientific and experimental data in a methodical and coherent fashion which is very much needed for future writing of scientific [ or technical ] reports and papers. It also prepares students about the methods of experiments to measure unknown quantities and draw conclusion from them. The university has two state of art Physics Laboratory, with modern equipments for Laboratory Classes [Physics Lab. I and Physics Lab. II] to perform experiments on the theoretical ideas delivered to them in the Physics I [General properties of matter, heat &amp; thermodynamics and mechanics] and Physics II [Electricity, magnetism, waves &amp; oscillations and optics] courses. <strong>Language Laboratory</strong> <img class="pull-left" src="/Files/Uploads/archive/eng11.gif" style="height:150px; width:200px" />The University has a language laboratory mainly used in English classes to enhance the verbal and listening skills of the students.
